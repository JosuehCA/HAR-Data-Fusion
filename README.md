# Welcome!

## This repo was made to hold as an archive the work me and my team did through the course of a whole semester, with the objective of comparing the performance of different classifiers as well as data fusion techniques. I added a copy of the jupyter notebook file I'd been using and a PDF version of it. Last but not least, the paper we managed to write, which is the culmination of our work. To pinpoint my exact contribution, the segment "3.1" was made entirely by me, in correspondance to the files here present in the repo. Thanks your reading :)
